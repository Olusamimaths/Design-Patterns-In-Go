# Design-Patterns-In-Go

Design patterns are typical solutions to problems in software design that commonly occur. 

Most design problems in code has been encountered before. Design patterns document the solution to such kinds of problems and you can customize them to solve a known design problem in your code. 

## Patterns Vs algorithms
Algorithm -> defines clear step by step actions to solve a problem
Pattern -> more high-level description of a solution. The implementation of a design pattern for two different programs may be different

## Structure of a pattern
Most patterns usually defined formally into some sections:
* **Intent** of the pattern -> describes both the problem and solution briefly
* **Motivation** expantiate on the problem and solution the pattern brings
* **Structure** of the classes show how each part of the pattern are related and how they work
* **Code Example** an implementation of the pattern in a programming language
