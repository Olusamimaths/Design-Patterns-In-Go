# Behavioural Design Patterns
Design Patterns that identify common communication patterns among objects.

Increases flexibility in carrying out communication

Describes the way objects and classes interact and divide responsibilities among themselves.

Abstracts an action you want to take from the object or class that takes the action

Uses object composition instead of inheritance

The key to understanding behavioural design patterns is *communication*

Focus shifts from the objects and classes that make up a design patten to the communication between objects and classes

In truest form of composition, Behavioural patterns are best understood in terms of how objects work together to perform tasks
